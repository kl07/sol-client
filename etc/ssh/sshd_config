# Configuration file for sshd(1m) (see also sshd_config(4))
#

#
# This file is used for the SunSSH and the OpenSSH versions of the sshd(1m)
# daemon. Commented out entries should match the defaults of the running
# sshd(1m) daemon. See the sshd(1m) man page for the defaults. Uncomment
# entries that override the defaults.
#

# Listen port (the IANA registered port number for ssh is 22)
#Port 22

# The default listen address is all interfaces, this may need to be changed
# if you wish to restrict the interfaces sshd listens on for a multi homed host.
# Multiple ListenAddress entries are allowed.

# IPv4 only
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
# SunSSH: IPv4 & IPv6, OpenSSH: IPv6 only!
#ListenAddress ::

# If port forwarding is enabled (default), specify if the server can bind to
# INADDR_ANY. 
# This allows the local port forwarding to work when connections are received
# from any remote host.
#GatewayPorts no

# X11 tunneling options
#X11DisplayOffset 10
#X11UseLocalhost yes
X11Forwarding yes

# The maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to sshd.
# start:rate:full see sshd(1) for more information.
#MaxStartups 10:30:100

# Banner to be printed before authentication starts.

# Should sshd print the /etc/motd file and check for mail.
# On Solaris it is assumed that the login shell will do these (eg /etc/profile).
PrintMotd no

# KeepAlive specifies whether keep alive messages are sent to the client.
# See sshd(1) for detailed description of what this means.
# Note that the client may also be sending keep alive messages to the server.
#KeepAlive yes

# Syslog facility and level

# Authentication configuration

# Host private key files
# Must be on a local disk and readable only by the root user (root:sys 600).
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key

# sshd regenerates the key every KeyRegenerationInterval seconds.
# The key is never stored anywhere except the memory of sshd.
# The default is 1 hour (3600 seconds).
#KeyRegenerationInterval 3600

# Ensure secure permissions on users .ssh directory.
#StrictModes yes

# Length of time in seconds before a client that hasn't completed
# authentication is disconnected.
# Default is 600 seconds. 0 means no time limit.
#LoginGraceTime 120

# Maximum number of retries for authentication
# Default is 6.
#MaxAuthTries	6

# Are logins to accounts with empty passwords allowed.
# If PermitEmptyPasswords is no, pass PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK 
# to pam_authenticate(3PAM).
#PermitEmptyPasswords no

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change PasswordAuthentication to no.
#PasswordAuthentication yes

# Are root logins permitted using sshd.
# Note that sshd uses pam_authenticate(3PAM) so the root (or any other) user
# maybe denied access by a PAM module regardless of this setting.
# Valid options are yes, without-password, no.
PermitRootLogin without-password

Subsystem	sftp	internal-sftp

# Uncomment if you don't trust ~/.ssh/known_hosts for RhostsRSAAuthentication.
#IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes
